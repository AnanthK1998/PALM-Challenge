# PALM-Challenge
This was a challenge in ISBI 2019 conference. This challenge has four subtasks : Image classification, Disc Segmentation, Lesion Segmentation and Fovea Localization. I have done the first three subtasks in this repository.

I have approached the classification subtask with the ResNet 50 architecture.

The segmentation subtasks were approached with the UNet architecture with ResNeXt-101 encoder using Keras.
